hunt_id: HUNT-001
technique: T1021.001
name: RDP lateral movement

hypothesis: >
  If an attacker uses RDP for lateral movement, we should see
  successful RDP logons from unusual hosts, accounts, or times.

required_telemetry:
  - Security Event ID 4624 (LogonType=10)
  - Security Event ID 4625 (failed attempts)
  - RDP connection events (1149)

hunt_steps:
  - Filter 4624 where LogonType=10
  - Identify source host and account
  - Compare against normal admin RDP patterns
  - Look for host-to-host chaining within short time windows

expected_noise:
  - IT administrators
  - Jump servers
  - Helpdesk activity
